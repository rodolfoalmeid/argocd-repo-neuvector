***Supported version: v5.3.0 onwards***

A new automated feature has been added as part of Controller and Enforcer to detect the K8s runtime on version 5.3.0. You do not need to specify a runtime engine socket location in your deployment.

**Enforcer:**

Enforcer currently supports 3 types of runtime engines (crio, containerd and docker). The automated feature will search the runtime engine from the node's configuration to connect the suitable runtime socket only if,
1. The automated detection feature does not work on your cluster.
2. If your host supports more than one runtime engine and you want to assign the specific runtime socket manually.

Added a generic mounted engine socket, "/run/runtime.sock", and the enforcer will iterate all its supported runtime engines to find the suitable one, therefore, there is no need to know the runtime type in advance.

```
 volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: /run/runtime.sock  <== predefined path name
         name: runtime-sock
         readOnly: false

    volumes:
        - name: runtime-sock
          hostPath:
            path: /var/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock   <== assigned socket path on the host 
```

**Controller:**

1. The "privlege mode" and "runtime" requirements are removed.
2. No mounted runtime socket is required on the k8s environment.
